 * bruceConfigPins.i2c_bus is user-configurable at runtime and may end up sharing the same

// as the PMIC, until the whole device is power-cycled). Reads SDA/SCL via digitalRead() only, so
// it never issues an I2C transaction and can't itself contend with one in progress. Call
// periodically (a few times a second is plenty) from a task that always runs regardless of what

 * card too) — both are alive for the entire program lifetime, so they always win. The other is a
 * single auxiliary hardware bus, reused one owner at a time by whichever peripheral
 * (CC1101/NRF24/LoRa/W5500/ST25R3916/...) is actively in use.
 *
 * A peripheral wired to a third, genuinely distinct set of pins has no hardware controller left:
 * acquireSPIBus() returns nullptr and the caller must fall back to its own software/bit-banged
 * SPI path (if the underlying driver supports one) or fail outright.
